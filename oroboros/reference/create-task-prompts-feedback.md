i like {feature-path}/development-notes.md instead


1. `{feature-path}/prd.md` - Feature requirements and acceptance criteria
2. `{epic-path}/requirements.md` - Epic context and scope
3. `oroboros/reference/tech-stack.md` - Technical patterns and conventions
4. `oroboros/reference/gotchas.md` - Known pitfalls to avoid
5. `{feature-path}/developmentNotes.md` - Notes from previous task groups

Anyhting else you suggest? I was thinking of task lists to see what came before and after. let's discuss


Anything else in the prompt, you think I should consider?
